# Hi, I'm Distromax 👋

## 🧪 I build long lasting software

I work on systems that keep infrastructure running.  
Maintenance workflows, industrial data, operational logic.  
If it has assets, sensors, schedules or machines, it interests me.

My background spans eighteen years of writing code, fixing old code and designing structures that survive the real world.  
I enjoy the intersection of software, hardware and operations.

- Middleware that talks to machines  
- Long lived architectures  
- Making old software behave better than expected
