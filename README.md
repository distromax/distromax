Senior Software Engineer with a focus on building stable, maintainable and production ready systems.

I work close to real world processes and operational constraints. My strength lies in translating complex domain requirements into software that remains understandable, reliable and operable over time.

I am particularly interested in system boundaries, long term maintainability and the realities of running software in production.

## 🧪 Professional focus

For almost two decades I have been working on adaptable software systems in the area of maintenance and asset management.

My work is shaped by real operational pressure: inspections, work orders, asset lifecycles, planned and unplanned maintenance, system integrations and the need to keep critical infrastructure running.

I am not a domain expert in maintenance itself. I understand the domain from a software and system perspective and know how to build solutions that fit into real operational environments.

Delphi appears occasionally when older systems require attention.

I work daily within the JetBrains ecosystem including Rider, ReSharper, YouTrack, TeamCity and Space.

Tools and technologies are interchangeable. What matters to me is system clarity, long term maintainability and operational reliability.
