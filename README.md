I enjoy programming as much as children enjoy playing in a sandbox or building sandcastles on the beach 🏖️
There is something deeply satisfying about shaping logic, connecting systems and watching ideas compile into real behaviour ⚙️✨
Programming never felt like an obligation, but rather a place to tinker ⚙️ and to create something from skretch, and to watch ideas turn into working systems 💡➡️💻

In the end, they're just sandcastles too — only these ones run on servers 🏰🖥️

One of the things I enjoy most is seeing my oldest son discover the same fascination for programming that pulled me in years ago. Watching him explore code with the same curiosity I once had feels like seeing the loop continue. We often talk about ideas, experiment together and share that quiet thrill when something finally works. It is a personal reminder that this craft is more than a job. It is something that can inspire across generations.

## 🧪 My profession

<details>
  <summary>... read more</summary>
<br>

For almost two decades I have been working in a company that builds software for maintenance and asset management. This is the domain I know best. My daily work has been shaped by the realities of inspections, work orders, asset lifecycles, planned and unplanned maintenance, interfaces to foreign systems and the operational pressure that comes with keeping infrastructure running. It is the field where my technical work meets real world processes.
